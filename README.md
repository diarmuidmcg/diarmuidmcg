### hello hello

I am Diarmuid (Deer-mid), an Irish-American from Boston currently studying in Ireland at Trinity College Dublin. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a freelance Full-stack Web Developer & App Developer. 


  At the moment, I'm doing Vue.js web work building out new features for Refunk Upcyclying, a Dublin based startup that wants to connect upcyclers (artisans who breathe new life into old furniture) with people with old furniture. This project has given me great exposure to the back-end side of things, working directly with TypeScript, TypeORM, & Postgres to name a few. 
  
  I'm concurrently building a React client app for Receipt Relay, a Galway based startup that grants small businessess the opportunity to provide e-receipts & provides insights on their customers. I'm building the client-facing portal that will be the vehicle for these insights.
  
  I'm also creating a React-native mobile app for Unipeer, another Dublin based startup that aims to create an online community for college societies. This project is part of my Trinity College Dublin Software Engineering course & I'm working with 5 other students. 

- ðŸ”­ I previously was cofounder & CEO of a startup Fonz Music.


  Fonz Music allowed Guests to make song requests to their Host's Spotify account using an NFC-enabled coaster, just like a jukebox. During the 18 months I was at the helm, I learned Front-end Web development in Vue.js, created an iOS App (& App Clip) in SwiftUI, & built a cross-platform Flutter application. 
Both the iOS & Flutter applications supported NFC Reading & writing, RESTful API calls, pagination, user auth. Our team of 4 made UX/UI & scalability our top priorities. 

  After this experience, I learned (the hard way) the importance of creating Unit-tests, mapping out projects, & syncing multiple codebases. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React, React-Native, & the back-end.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about creating iOS App Clips & using NFC for both iOS & Android.

- ðŸ˜ˆ Fun Fact -> I've previously taught myself French & am currently learning Italian as I aim to be a digital nomad.
