### hello hello

I am Diarmuid (Deer-mid), an Irish-American from Boston who studied in Ireland at Trinity College Dublin & is now moving to Lille to work for [Miam](miam.tech). 

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently exploring new technologies

  I am working on [JarRing](https://github.com/diarmuidmcg/hereSince), a Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile App that leverages NFC to make it easier to manage my jars (of coffee, tea, couscous, etc). Each jar lid has an NFC sticker -> when tapped the app shows useful information such as how long the product has been there, ingridients, caffeination, etc.
I am using a MongoDB Atlas database & the Realm SDK to store & update the data as well as handle user authentication. 

  Here is my [Resume](https://rxresu.me/diarmuiddevs/ireland)

- ðŸ”­ I have worked as a freelance Full-stack Web Developer & App Developer. 

  I worked on Vue.js web work & Nest.js backend work building out new features for Refunk Upcyclying, a Dublin based startup that wants to connect upcyclers (artisans who breathe new life into old furniture) with people with old furniture. This project has gave me great exposure to the back-end side of things, working directly with TypeScript, TypeORM, & Postgres to name a few. It also cemented my front-end Vue.js skills.
  
  I concurrently built a React client app for Receipt Relay, a Galway based startup that grants small businessess the opportunity to provide e-receipts & provides insights on their customers. I built a client-facing portal for providing insights.
  
  I also created a React-native mobile app for Unipeer, another Dublin based startup that aims to create an online community for college societies. This project was part of my Trinity College Dublin Software Engineering course & I worked with 5 other students. 

- ðŸ”­ I previously was cofounder & CEO of a startup Fonz Music.


  [Fonz Music](https://github.com/Fonz-Music) allowed Guests to make song requests to their Host's Spotify account using an NFC-enabled coaster, just like a jukebox. During the 18 months I was at the helm, I learned Front-end Web development in Vue.js, created an iOS App (& App Clip) in SwiftUI, & built a cross-platform Flutter application. 
Both the iOS & Flutter applications supported NFC Reading & writing, RESTful API calls, pagination, user auth. Our team of 4 made UX/UI & scalability our top priorities. 

  After this experience, I learned (the hard way) the importance of creating Unit-tests, mapping out projects, & syncing multiple codebases. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin Multiplatform, MongoDB Atlas, & Arduino.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about creating iOS App Clips & using NFC for both iOS & Android.

- ðŸ˜ˆ Fun Fact -> I've previously taught myself French & am currently learning Italian as I aim to be a digital nomad.
