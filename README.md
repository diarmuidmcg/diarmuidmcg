### hello hello

I am Diarmuid (Deer-mid), an Irish-American from Boston who studied in Ireland at Trinity College Dublin & is now living in Lille to work for [Mealz](mealz.ai). 

- ðŸ”­ I'm a cross platform Mobile Developer

  At Mealz, we use Kotlin Multiplatform to provide an iOS & Android SDK to our clients. I initially specialized in the iOS part of our SDK, but moved to Android & our "core" in Kotlin as well. I love KMP & intend to use it for any & all personal projects in the future.

- ðŸ”­ I'm building an NFC in KMP open source project

  Having working extensively with NFC (near field communication) at my own startup Fonz & now KMP with Mealz, I have decided to create [an open source libary to make using NFC in KMP](https://github.com/diarmuidmcg/nfc_in_kmp) more straightforward. Modeled off [nfc_manager](https://pub.dev/packages/nfc_manager) in Flutter that I used initially when developing Fonz, my goal is to allow any cross-platform developer to have a plug-&-play SDK to support NFC on both iOS & Android. I have taken an iOS-first approach because iOS is much more limited when it comes to NFC support.

- ðŸ”­ Some previous side projects:

  I built [JarRing](https://github.com/diarmuidmcg/hereSince), a Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile App that leverages NFC to make it easier to manage my jars (of coffee, tea, couscous, etc). Each jar lid has an NFC sticker -> when tapped the app shows useful information such as how long the product has been there, ingredients, caffeination, etc.
I am using a MongoDB Atlas database & the Realm SDK to store & update the data as well as handle user authentication. 

  Here is my [Resume](https://rxresu.me/diarmuiddevs/ireland)

- ðŸ”­ I have worked as a freelance Full-stack Web Developer & App Developer. 

  I worked on Vue.js web work & Nest.js backend work building out new features for Refunk Upcyclying, a Dublin based startup that wants to connect upcyclers (artisans who breathe new life into old furniture) with people with old furniture. This project has gave me great exposure to the back-end side of things, working directly with TypeScript, TypeORM, & Postgres to name a few. It also cemented my front-end Vue.js skills.
  
  I concurrently built a React client app for Receipt Relay, a Galway based startup that grants small businessess the opportunity to provide e-receipts & provides insights on their customers. I built a client-facing portal for providing insights.
  
  I also created a React-native mobile app for Unipeer, another Dublin based startup that aims to create an online community for college societies. This project was part of my Trinity College Dublin Software Engineering course & I worked with 5 other students. 

- ðŸ”­ I previously was cofounder & CEO of a startup Fonz Music.

  [Fonz Music](https://github.com/Fonz-Music) allowed Guests to make song requests to their Host's Spotify account using an NFC-enabled coaster, just like a jukebox. During the 18 months I was at the helm, I learned Front-end Web development in Vue.js, created an iOS App (& App Clip) in SwiftUI, & built a cross-platform Flutter application. 
Both the iOS & Flutter applications supported NFC Reading & writing, RESTful API calls, pagination, user auth. Our team of 4 made UX/UI & scalability our top priorities. 

  After this experience, I learned (the hard way) the importance of creating Unit-tests, mapping out projects, & syncing multiple codebases. 

- ðŸŒ± I love people, so I'm leaning on having a more client-facing position next 

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about creating iOS App Clips & using NFC for both iOS & Android.

- ðŸ˜ˆ Fun Fact -> I moved to France with very poor French... & just learned it on the job!
